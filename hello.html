    <h1>Hello..!</h1>
    <h2>This is powerfull machine...!</h2>
    <P><b>Interior quality</b> - The materials used in both are at par, with some good finishes and some obvious
        cost-cutting. Passenger comfort in the front is at par. The middle row in the Scorpio is way better both in
        terms of seat comfort, and the ride quality.

    <P>The Scorpio is renowned for its bold and aggressive aesthetics, coupled with a robust engine. However, the N
        series, while lacking in aggressive looks, boasts an even more potent engine. It may not be as massive as the
        Fortuner but holds the title of the largest Indian-made SUV to date.
